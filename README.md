## Getting Started


#### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory and install all dependencies using the following command

```shell
yarn install
```

#### 2. Run the application and Sanity Studio

To concurrently run both apps, use the following command from the root directory

```shell
yarn dev
```

#### 3. Open the app and sign in to the Studio

Open the Nuxt app running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Open the Studio running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.
